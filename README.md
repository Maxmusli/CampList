# [CampList](http://camplist-mern.herokuapp.com/#/)
A site built for campers, by campers.


## Background and Overview

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is responsible for overseeing approximately 250 million acres or â…› of the entire country. While the agency maintains regulated zones for some recreational activity, there are many areas of the BLM outside of these boundaries which contain unlisted camp sites, hiking trails, and other attractions.
